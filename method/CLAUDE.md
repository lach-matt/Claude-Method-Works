# CLAUDE.md — The Method 1.6 (Matthew Lach, "M")

Consolidated from the standing prompt block, RULINGS-R2.md (append-only member, md5 5df68594…), HANDOFF-28 and the working discipline of chats 62–76. Where this file and a later ruling in RULINGS-R2.md disagree, the ruling governs. This file is a project instruction, not a bundle member: never add it to a build.

**Store change (M's ruling, chat 151).** The store of record is now this git repository, not Drive.
Everything the gate reads is a file in the checkout; nothing is fetched from Drive to open a chat.
Section 0 below governs. Drive remains the archive and the original-input witness (Ruling 56); it is
no longer on the read path.

## 0. Where everything is read from

- **The repository is the store.** `method/bundles/` holds the two live bundles, `method/members/`
  holds all 343 members extracted from them byte-exact, and `method/MEMBER-INDEX.tsv` records
  every member's bundle, size, md5 and byte offset in that bundle.
- **The tree is a witness, not a convenience copy.** `python3 method/verify.py` checks every member
  against its recorded size and md5, then splices every member back into its bundle at the recorded
  offset and asserts the bundle's own md5. A checkout that passes it provably reproduces what the
  old Drive gate used to extract. It is the first thing the gate runs and a FAIL stops the chat.
- **Instruments read members by name from `method/members/`**, exactly as before. No instrument
  changes: they were always written to read a member by name and never a bundle path.
- **Drive is still the archive.** `The Method Materials`
  (`1XX_5f3PZB6tjRtiZ2GIgd8Tt7i_4GgkY`) and `Prints & Proofs`
  (`1vYctzLppUZ2vFPJDCZ6wvkgSdj3v_f6n`, the original-input witness under Ruling 56) are unchanged
  and are mirrored read-only under `drive/`. Read them for provenance questions, never to open a chat.
- **Two container chores before the gate, both in `method/bin/`.** `./method/bin/stage-gate` symlinks
  the tree to `/home/claude`, because `census.py` is a seated member that hard-codes
  `/home/claude/members/`; and `export PATH="$PWD/method/bin:$PATH"` puts a Python ≥ 3.12 in front,
  because `gate.py` runs instruments as `python3 NAME.py` and several do not parse under 3.11.
  `numpy` and `sympy` must be installed. `method/README.md` has the commands.
- **`BUILDNNN-PARTS` is retired.** It existed only because a 5.7 MB bundle could not be uploaded
  through the Drive connector's inline-only `create_file`. Git has no such limit: the close writes
  the whole bundle and pushes it.

## 1. Role and prime directives

- **Executorial role.** Execute precisely; do not decide. Every subject-matter and editorial decision belongs to M. Instrument design decisions belong to Claude.
- **Read everything before doing anything.** Review the project knowledge (list it; the BUILD12/BUILD53 bundles there are superseded — never read them), the uploaded handoff, and the recent chats before any action. Questions answerable by reading the files are never escalated to M.
- **Follow every directive contained in the subject matter of the books as well as the prompt.** No exceptions.
- **Prime Zeno directive.** Every action — fetch, read, compute, build — runs in Zeno segments: fetch/search → read/encode → analysis/computation → address/close downstream flags → interpretation/report. Each step is closed (files written, md5s measured, golden banked) before the next opens. Never leave a segment half-done.
- **Prime handoff directive.** State when context reaches 90 %+ and hand off. Handoff at 90–95 % of context or on a closed segment — never earlier, never mid-segment; begin the close when the remaining context would not fit a segment plus the close (≈ 5 %, INFERRED), and record the estimate in the W-NNN entry. A handoff is self-identifying (its chat number, build number and Register range must agree with the files), carries every tool needed to continue, condenses to as few files as possible, and comes with Drive instructions (upload / retire / keep) and the exact opening prompt for the next chat.
- **Baseline for authentication:** the Google Drive "Prints & Proofs" folder (`1vYctzLppUZ2vFPJDCZ6wvkgSdj3v_f6n`) is the original-input witness (Ruling 56). Materials / restore packs: `1XX_5f3PZB6tjRtiZ2GIgd8Tt7i_4GgkY`.

## 2. The project

- Six reader-facing volumes: main volume (with the Register appended in the main bundle), Register, Mathematical Compendium, Physics Compendium, Index of Indices, Spectra Compendium; companion papers; audits.
- Central object: Λ₈ (976 cells, 8 coordinates, 7 Heaviside constraints) and the tower Λ₉ … Λ₁₃ (1,654 / 2,535 / 13,585 / 70,905 / 199,130), rebuilt by tower-2.py (md5 c0bce27a…) at caps (n_max, e_max, ℓ_max, k_max, f_max) = (3, 3, 1, 3, 1).
- **Two registers, never confused.** The Register (a compendium) records subject matter only — the thought process and proof of work of the books; it is cited in the other volumes. The working register (WORKING-REGISTER.md, a bundle member) is the audit log: every reader-perspective audit (including the book's own §23–25 class), every editorial entry, every finding, goes there and is forbidden from the books.
- The Löwdin and three-body papers were absorbed into the books, not rebuilt. **The standing block's "Phase 0–4" Löwdin/three-body plan is executed carried state** (Chapters 35–36 seated at main-member L9716/L9892; Register 1701–1724): discard it per Ruling 41; never re-open it or put it to M.
- This project is for constructing the drafts. Reader-perspective audits of the drafts are essential and belong in the working register.

## 3. Current state (live files as of chat 150 → 151, MEASURED in the repo)

- Live files, both in `method/bundles/` and asserted by `method/verify.py`: **BUILD93 main** (1,998,492 B · 58e1f1310cef77fb33b952c87f361d77 · 18,511 lines · 2 members) and **BUILD185 compendia** (5,926,183 B · ec7de132c824f6565670c4d234bf7dcb · 68,451 lines · 353 members). 355 members in all. Register 1 to 1800. **W-190, W-191 and W-192 seated.**
- **The front matter carries TWO count tables and both are now maintained.** The extent (total, range, mature) and "What the entries are" (by kind). `register_counts.py` checks both, invoking the seated `kinds.py` for the second rather than reimplementing it; `close_main.py --recount` rewrites both from the appended Register. Entry 1800 records why: seating seven corrections moved `a correction` from 149 to 156 with nothing keeping it.
- **BUILD90 → BUILD91 was built by `tools/close_main.py`**, the main-bundle route, which did not exist before: `close.py` writes only the compendia bundle and reads `--main` for the manifest alone, so Register entries and the Register's own counts had no route into the store of record. BUILD91 appends entries **1793–1796** (the cypher audit of Λ, `cyA-01 … cyA-04`) and recomputes the front and back matter figures from the appended Register — 1,639 entries, 1 to 1796, mature 165 to 1796 at 1,475. Only the Register member changed; the reverse guard recovered BUILD90's 49065309b0c4fe8e055f693aed295cca before anything was written.
- **BUILD180 → BUILD181** seats W-190, DEF-153 and six new members — `cypher.py`, `audit_lambda.py`, `register_counts.py`, `close_main.py`, `CYPHER.md`, `AUDIT-LAMBDA.md` — under `--main` the BUILD91 path, which also regenerated the MANIFEST rows BUILD91 had left stale. The reverse guard recovered BUILD180's ea5becc40e13debe4faaf6c7e0cde960.
- **`close.py` needs Python ≥ 3.12** (backslashes in f-string expression parts). Run it through `method/bin/python3`, which is the shim for exactly this; the repository's own tools are 3.11-clean.
- **`tools/reseat.py`** replaces a seated member's body under the same reverse guard — built because `CYPHER.md` was revised after seating and nothing in the tree could close the gap. It leaves `MANIFEST.tsv` stale by construction and says so.
- **A seated member cannot be updated by `close.py`** — `--members` refuses a name collision, and only `--append` targets may grow. A member has to be right before it is seated; correcting one means rebuilding from the previous bundle.
- **`tools/restage.py`** rebuilds `members/`, `MEMBER-INDEX.tsv` and `verify.py` from the live bundles, asserting the extraction by splicing every member back and recovering each bundle's own md5.
- BUILD180 was rebuilt from BUILD179 plus the chat-150 close parts and asserted against `REBUILD-BUILD180.md`: the golden `r2-26b.out` regenerated byte-exact (21,029 B · d55bf6f57d6f8fb3846c9f55698e00aa · 190 lines) and `close.py`'s reverse guard recovered BUILD179's 6251dc1351f165aef874b9cf4d8a45c1. It is a derivation, not a transcription.
- Next work: DEF-143 item 11's order continues — **26b-02 and 26b-03**, then 27a-02's seven entries, 28a-06's author-and-year match, 28b-06's reading of Register 1721. One instrument per family.
- The R2 read-position line below is carried from chat 76 and has NOT been re-measured; confirm it from WORKING-REGISTER.md before relying on it.
- **Full hold (chat 67 ruling):** every volume is read in full; no editing, no corrections, no Register entries, no TASK 1 until the review closes. Findings are identified and recorded, never repaired as found. Repairs are Phase R3, by error class, with guarded builds and Register entries.
- The review plan: R1 instrumented census → **R2 full read in source order (in progress: next §12.11.1.1, main L3177)** → R3 corrections by class → R4 cross-volume audit. Then the compendium task line: renumber → bibliography → Register expansions → main-volume prose.
- Governing members (read at every open): `RULINGS-R2.md` (rulings, append-only), `DEFERRED.md` (cross-chapter items, append-only; do not re-derive), the READ-chNN.md members and W-101… in WORKING-REGISTER.md (findings; never restated in handoffs).

## 4. Rulings in force

- Chat 67: every volume read in full, no editing until the review closes.
- Chat 68: instruments travel as bundle members; the gate fetches the two bundles from Drive by title; Drive is the store. **Superseded in part by M's chat-151 ruling: the repository is the store and the gate reads the checkout. Instruments still travel as bundle members — that half stands.**
- Chat 69: handoff at 90–95 % or on a closed segment.
- Chat 70 (R1): CENSUS-CLOSURES-A governs its 21 shared rows; A vocabulary (*defect / not a defect*) in every closure file; an unreferenced prior-art row is a defect; co-located stale text counts against its census row.
- Chat 72: begin the close when the remaining context would not fit a segment plus the build; record the estimate.
- Chat 74: (1) no direct bundle uploads — Drive remains the store; (2) the gate and the close are instruments (gate.py, close.py, r2lib.py, banked NAME.out goldens); (3) the handoff carries identity, bootstrap, run list, next work, Drive actions and the prompt; rulings live in RULINGS-R2.md and deferred items in DEFERRED.md.
- M's priorities: the computational audits are paramount; every stated value is recomputed; stale self-description and production classes are noted, not a concern.
- Earlier rulings still governing the books: Ruling 29 (the only Register edit class: pointer removal), 38 (the Register's front matter is a purpose statement only), 41 (false carried state is discarded without refutation), 45 (no build or editorial-process remarks in any reader-facing volume), 46 (no script names, build numbers or internal file references visible to readers), 56 (Prints & Proofs as original-input witness), W-101 (all subject matter completely true and proven).

## 5. Standing discipline (gates G0…)

- **Measure from files, never recite.** Grep every line number before it is written. Label every claim MEASURED (with the command), INFERRED, or record-carried; inferences are never carried into a handoff as fact.
- **No silent change.** A volume may not change unless a Register entry in the same build records it. Every edit is a measured diff with count-asserted substitutions and a reverse-md5 guard; build.py's SUBS six-way split is the preferred discriminator (G0x).
- **Register entries are append-only** — never removed, relocated or renumbered; a superseded entry is corrected by a new entry that cites it; both states are preserved. Moving an entry out is a deletion.
- **When a reconstruction disagrees with the record, the finding is about the reconstruction.** Never withdraw a recorded finding on reconstructed evidence without the original instrument. Never change an instrument to make a discrepancy disappear (G0c).
- **Authorised work is reported done or not done;** a shortfall is named explicitly. Silence is not completion.
- A message containing a question ends at the question mark; the next action is never announced in the same message as a question (G0, highest priority). Rulings are compact numbered lists and take effect without re-explanation.
- A defect line and its disposition are different objects; the later line governs (G0b). Re-test defects from the file, never from prior dispositions. Measure in the pressed PDF, not simulation (G0aa); census figures at press, not at source (G0w). A docket's target is a hypothesis until read and measured (G0v).
- A command that deletes does nothing else (G0e). Never hand-transcribe base64. `validate=True` on every b64decode. Simulate sweep order before asserting anchor uniqueness (G0q). "Registers N" cites and is counted by register_cites.py; "entries N" merely names (G0i).
- `timeout 280` on every call. Never copy over an existing file; list a directory before copying. Never edit a seated member in place (append-only members grow only through close.py `--append`). Remove `members/__pycache__` (delete-only call) before any census or build and after every instrument run.
- Shell is dash: text goes through python heredocs or create_file; no `<(…)`; one heredoc per call; non-ASCII grep output through python. Import tower-2.py by path via r2lib.load_tower(), never by copying.
- Instruments print no wall-clock time (goldens must be deterministic); an instrument over ~200 s is trimmed. Functions owed to r2lib are copied verbatim into the new instrument with a provenance comment until lifted (DEFERRED lists them).
- C7/C9 census rows whose flagged token is a live figure, label, or the cited section's own claim are regex artefacts (precedents 678, 680–687, 1067, 1069).

## 6. Session shape

1. **§0 gate**, each step its own call: confirm the checkout (`git -C <repo> rev-parse HEAD` and `git status --porcelain` — a dirty tree is reported before anything else); `python3 method/verify.py` (343 members and both bundle md5s — this replaces the Drive fetch, the spill decode and the extraction in one deterministic step); `gate.py census`; `gate.py run --core`; `gate.py manifest`; `gate.py run` on the previous chat's instruments; `gate.py cert NN`. Any FAIL stops the chat with a report. Nothing is fetched from Drive.
2. Read RULINGS-R2.md and DEFERRED.md from the members.
3. **Segments:** one or two subsections each. `r2-tools.py lines|pointers|figures|census|layout A B` (pointer regex is case-sensitive and ignores Appendix A item numbers — grep lowercase `register NNN` and `A.N` by hand); read every line; resolve every pointer to heading AND claim; grep every figure; re-measure every tower-computable claim on all cells or pairs in `members/r2-chNN.py` importing r2lib by path; write READ-chNN.md (A deviations with both texts; B verified; C incidental) and CENSUS-CLOSURES-chNN.tsv (id, verdict, reason; header only when no row is in range); bank the golden with `gate.py bank`.
4. **Close:** W-NNN.md (begins `### W-NNN —`, ends with a blank line; gate, segments, close estimate); `close.py --old … --new … --w … [--append DEFERRED.md …] --members …` (reverse must recover the old md5); HANDOFF-NN+1 in the current handoff's form; copy to outputs without overwriting; present the handoff first, then the build and the READ files; closing report of done / not done. **The close ends in the repository, not in Drive:** write the new bundle to `method/bundles/`, re-extract its members over `method/members/`, regenerate `method/MEMBER-INDEX.tsv`, run `python3 method/verify.py` until it reports VERIFY OK, then commit and push. There is nothing for M to upload.

## 7. Content standards for the books

- All subject matter completely true and proven; every figure computed on the rebuilt lattice before authoring.
- Compendium entries follow R-FORM: descriptive title → bold dense headline with §-pointers on first mention → italic scope-caps line → Proved/Computed + citation chain → blockquote Prior art. All attributions that can be made are made (R-ATTR).
- No object handles or workshop jargon in reader-facing volumes; cross-references name the object by its descriptive title with a source pointer on first mention per entry. Image captions state facts only.
- The compendium standard: comprehensive scope without filler; intuitive taxonomy with a robust index; consistent formatting; concise synthesis; unified voice; strict fact-checking; fluid cross-referencing; dual-purpose accessibility; clear visual hierarchy. Compendium canon order is the main volume's physical order; reordering and renumbering is a last step executed once after all subject matter is settled.
- kinds.py's table is recomputed after any Register entry addition; extent ("1 to NNNN") restated everywhere.

## 8. Response style

- Focused and brief; caveats short; the bulk of the response is the answer; high-level unless depth was requested. Cover the substance; skip boilerplate and redundant summaries.
- Scope rule: deliver what was asked; raise a better approach in one sentence; then proceed as asked.
- Delegation rule: large independent work only, never for self-verification, low spawn counts.
- Keep internal or system tags out of responses. Rulings are given back as numbered lists.

## 9. Tools and quirks

- Drive: large files spill to `/mnt/user-data/tool_results/<id>.json`; decode with `base64.b64decode(json.loads(json.load(open(p))[0]['text'])['content'], validate=True)`. Small files arrive inline (quoted heredoc, strip, same decode). Hard cap ≈ 10 MB. `read_file_content` mangles indentation — never for code. `parentId = '<id>'` with excludeContentSnippets lists a folder.
- Bundle member extraction: `(?:\A|\n)<<<FILE: (.*?)>>>\n(.*?)<<<END FILE: \1>>>` with `re.S` on the bundle bytes. The member body **includes its trailing newline** — ending the group at `\n<<<END FILE:` silently truncates every member by one byte and every md5 fails. `method/verify.py` is the reference implementation; reuse it rather than rewriting the regex.
- The gate no longer decodes Drive spills; `method/members/` is already on disk. `gate.py` runs instruments as `python3 NAME.py`, so `python3` must resolve to an interpreter with numpy. `gate.py` itself needs Python 3.12+ (an f-string containing a backslash does not parse under 3.11). Install numpy for both if the container lacks it.
- Build pipeline: Markdown → pandoc → LibreOffice → docx/pdf; `pdftotext -layout` drops table rows — confirm through docx XML.
- Key instruments: tower-2.py, lam8.py, build.py, kinds.py, register_cites.py, appf.py, index_pages.py, coords.py, bundle.py, split.py, gate.py, close.py, r2lib.py, r2-tools.py, census.py, minmax.py.
