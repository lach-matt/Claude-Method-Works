# `research/`

Original research produced **from** the corpus, never **into** it.

Nothing in this tree is a bundle member, a Register entry, or mirrored Drive content. Nothing here is
read by the §0 gate. `method/`, `drive/`, `extracted/` and `recovered/` are inputs to this tree and are
never written to by it — the chat-67 full hold governs, so a finding made here is **recorded, never
repaired** into a volume.

Each subdirectory holds one paper and the instrument that computes its numbers. Every instrument is
stdlib-only and takes a `--selftest` whose fixtures are the corpus's own printed figures and the
literature's own printed figures — never a number the paper invented. Run the selftest before trusting
a report.

| paper | instrument | subject |
|---|---|---|
| `warp-drive/WARP-DRIVE.md` | `warp-drive/warpdrive.py` | where a warp drive sits in the fifteen-letter violation index, what warp energy is, and which engine can be built |

| **`warp-drive/LAUNCHER`** | **`warp-drive/launcher.py`** | **what the shell can be, since it cannot be a drive: a geodesic launcher at 0 g — the drive is the infrastructure, not the ship** |
| **`warp-drive/GATE 1`** | **`warp-drive/gate1.py`** | **the build spec: degenerate matter from a neutron star, accretion power, the meridional schematic, and the two parameters that vary gate to gate** |
| **`warp-drive/RESIDUE`** | **`warp-drive/residue.py`** | **the three opens are one question; it closes in two directions and leaves one geometry to test** |
| `warp-drive/paper/PAPER.md` | — | ⚠ WITHDRAWN draft of the shell paper, kept as the record of what did not stand |

## `warp-drive/`

Seats the warp drive — cited twice in `method/members/Transitions.md` and never named again — as an
object threshold in that paper's own index, and computes its energy budget and engine specification
against the primary literature.

```

`WARP-DRIVE.md` answers the question from the index and the literature. `ENGINE-ASSESSMENT.md`
reviews `drive/The Method Materials/warp drive theory.pdf` — the design deliverable, seated in the
mirror by `drive_sync.py --adopt` at status `ok-adopted` — against the same physics, and computes
every claim in it that is computable.

`pdftext.py` beside them is not an audit instrument and takes no selftest: it is a PDF text extractor
written because this container has neither poppler nor `pypdf`, and because the producer of that file
puts page layout in `q`/`cm`/`Q` graphics transforms, encodes glyphs as two-byte hex through
`/ToUnicode`, and emits spaces as explicit glyphs. It tracks the full CTM and never inserts a space
heuristically.

The fourteen papers run in order. `WARP-DRIVE.md` places the object and gives the buildable
specification. `ENGINE-ASSESSMENT.md` reviews M's design deliverable against it.
`ROTATING-SHELL.md` takes the one idea in that deliverable which survived review and carries it onto
the buildable solution. `SHIFT-CEILING.md` answers the one number Fuchs et al. named as open — how
far the shift vector can be pushed before the drive stops being physical — and finds a closed form.
`SHELL-PROFILE.md` then replaces that paper's eyeballed input with a TOV integration and corrects it
downward, and `ACCELERATION.md` prices the problem all five defer. A paper is never edited to match a
later finding: `SHIFT-CEILING.md` and `SHELL-PROFILE.md` carry notes naming what superseded them, and
every state stands. `SOURCE-CODE.md` is where the series corrects itself — it reads the authors'
published toolkit and finds two of this series' own inferences wrong, both in the flattering
direction. `MEASURED.md` then runs that toolkit under GNU Octave and replaces every inferred number
with a measured one, and `WHAT-BINDS.md` measures the two things that paper left open — overturning
a design rule this series had published, and raising one careful question about the instrument
everything downstream depends on. `THE-DESIGN-EQUATION.md` then applies **P8** — *any true answer,
good or bad, is a bound*, and *three bounds on one object are a coordinate* (`The_Method_1_6-2.md`
§2.15, §2.17.3) — to the bounds the first nine established, and turns them from a limit into a design
equation with a measured 1.6x gain and a bound on the whole family. `DENSITY-IS-CLOSED.md` then
builds the first of the two levers that bound named, measures it, and closes it — leaving one. `SPHERICITY.md` measures what that last one costs, attempts
it, and reports the attempt invalidated by its own control: the lever is untested rather than closed,
and the class bound is not final. `THE-BORROWED-WELL.md` then applies **register 1206** — *"E_W = 0
was the Method equation reporting that no STEP could carry a value"* — reads the design equation
backwards, and finds that the transport the shell manufactures can be borrowed instead, in closed
form and for nothing.

The instrument copies the fifteen-letter closure rules verbatim from `recovered/objects15.py` with a
provenance comment, per the standing rule that an instrument imports a seated form and never silently
reimplements one. It reproduces `TRANSITIONS` §7.1's printed 18,888 / 18,072 / 816 before reporting
anything.


## The turn

The first fourteen papers asked whether a **warp shell** can be built and answered by optimising the
only object that satisfies all four energy conditions while carrying a shift. The answer was no, by
10³¹ — and two papers later it became clear the ceiling those papers measured was an artefact of a
bad slice and a mis-lowered index (`NEC-CORRECTION.md`). Correcting it doubles the ceiling and
changes nothing: a 2× correction to a number 31 orders from useful is not a result.

The assumption those papers never examined is that an engine **sources** the metric it uses. Both
lethal facts — the 10³¹ gap and the ADM no-self-acceleration theorem — follow from it alone.
`THE-ENGINE.md` drops it. An engine is a **coupler**: a device that modulates its coupling to a
gradient it did not make. Built of ordinary matter, it satisfies every energy condition trivially,
because there is nothing exotic in it to check.

Two couplers are assessed. The **curvature swimmer** (Wisdom 2003) is a real effect and a dead
engine, bounded by `Δs ≤ A·a_tide/c²` ≈ 10⁻¹⁵ m per cycle — recorded as a bound. The **binary
slingshot** is live: a black hole binary is a flywheel already spinning, the fractional gain in γ per
pass does not saturate, and a steered vehicle keeps the first-order law a random population loses.
Worked point design: **0.87 c in 11 minutes at 1 g with zero propellant**, off two 27,900 M☉ holes.

Its honest limit is not physics but **inventory** — the engine is a found object, and no
intermediate-mass black hole binary is confirmed nearby. That reduces the question to an
observational one, which LISA is built to answer.

**A second scaling error, found later and larger than the first.** Every mass and density figure in
the first fifteen papers was quoted at the published example's `R₁ = 10 m`, and the size was never
varied. But `M ∝ R` while `ρ ∝ 1/R²`, so "666,000 × nuclear density" describes a 20 m ship and not
warp shells. `THE-DRIVE.md` runs the trade: there is **no material that makes a small warp shell**,
and **nuclear matter makes a 5 km one** — 1.11 M☉, 0.0476 c, flat interior, all four energy
conditions satisfied, by internal circulation at 0.330 c geared 6.94:1. That is the original
Architecture B topology at the right scale. The bill is ~10⁴⁶ J twice over and a neutron star: one
stellar catastrophe, not 10³¹.
