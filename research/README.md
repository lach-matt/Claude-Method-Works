# `research/`

Original research produced **from** the corpus, never **into** it.

Nothing in this tree is a bundle member, a Register entry, or mirrored Drive content. Nothing here is
read by the §0 gate. `method/`, `drive/`, `extracted/` and `recovered/` are inputs to this tree and are
never written to by it — the chat-67 full hold governs, so a finding made here is **recorded, never
repaired** into a volume.

Each subdirectory holds one paper and the instrument that computes its numbers. Every instrument is
stdlib-only and takes a `--selftest` whose fixtures are the corpus's own printed figures and the
literature's own printed figures — never a number the paper invented. Run the selftest before trusting
a report.

## `warp-drive/`

Seats the warp drive — cited twice in `method/members/Transitions.md` and never named again — as an
object threshold in that paper's own index, and computes its energy budget and engine specification
against the primary literature.

```

`WARP-DRIVE.md` answers the question from the index and the literature. `ENGINE-ASSESSMENT.md`
reviews `drive/The Method Materials/warp drive theory.pdf` — the design deliverable, seated in the
mirror by `drive_sync.py --adopt` at status `ok-adopted` — against the same physics, and computes
every claim in it that is computable.

`pdftext.py` beside them is not an audit instrument and takes no selftest: it is a PDF text extractor
written because this container has neither poppler nor `pypdf`, and because the producer of that file
puts page layout in `q`/`cm`/`Q` graphics transforms, encodes glyphs as two-byte hex through
`/ToUnicode`, and emits spaces as explicit glyphs. It tracks the full CTM and never inserts a space
heuristically.

The fourteen papers run in order. `WARP-DRIVE.md` places the object and gives the buildable
specification. `ENGINE-ASSESSMENT.md` reviews M's design deliverable against it.
`ROTATING-SHELL.md` takes the one idea in that deliverable which survived review and carries it onto
the buildable solution. `SHIFT-CEILING.md` answers the one number Fuchs et al. named as open — how
far the shift vector can be pushed before the drive stops being physical — and finds a closed form.
`SHELL-PROFILE.md` then replaces that paper's eyeballed input with a TOV integration and corrects it
downward, and `ACCELERATION.md` prices the problem all five defer. A paper is never edited to match a
later finding: `SHIFT-CEILING.md` and `SHELL-PROFILE.md` carry notes naming what superseded them, and
every state stands. `SOURCE-CODE.md` is where the series corrects itself — it reads the authors'
published toolkit and finds two of this series' own inferences wrong, both in the flattering
direction. `MEASURED.md` then runs that toolkit under GNU Octave and replaces every inferred number
with a measured one, and `WHAT-BINDS.md` measures the two things that paper left open — overturning
a design rule this series had published, and raising one careful question about the instrument
everything downstream depends on. `THE-DESIGN-EQUATION.md` then applies **P8** — *any true answer,
good or bad, is a bound*, and *three bounds on one object are a coordinate* (`The_Method_1_6-2.md`
§2.15, §2.17.3) — to the bounds the first nine established, and turns them from a limit into a design
equation with a measured 1.6x gain and a bound on the whole family. `DENSITY-IS-CLOSED.md` then
builds the first of the two levers that bound named, measures it, and closes it — leaving one. `SPHERICITY.md` measures what that last one costs, attempts
it, and reports the attempt invalidated by its own control: the lever is untested rather than closed,
and the class bound is not final. `THE-BORROWED-WELL.md` then applies **register 1206** — *"E_W = 0
was the Method equation reporting that no STEP could carry a value"* — reads the design equation
backwards, and finds that the transport the shell manufactures can be borrowed instead, in closed
form and for nothing.

The instrument copies the fifteen-letter closure rules verbatim from `recovered/objects15.py` with a
provenance comment, per the standing rule that an instrument imports a seated form and never silently
reimplements one. It reproduces `TRANSITIONS` §7.1's printed 18,888 / 18,072 / 816 before reporting
anything.


## The turn

The first fourteen papers asked whether a **warp shell** can be built and answered by optimising the
only object that satisfies all four energy conditions while carrying a shift. The answer was no, by
10³¹ — and two papers later it became clear the ceiling those papers measured was an artefact of a
bad slice and a mis-lowered index (`NEC-CORRECTION.md`). Correcting it doubles the ceiling and
changes nothing: a 2× correction to a number 31 orders from useful is not a result.

The assumption those papers never examined is that an engine **sources** the metric it uses. Both
lethal facts — the 10³¹ gap and the ADM no-self-acceleration theorem — follow from it alone.
`THE-ENGINE.md` drops it. An engine is a **coupler**: a device that modulates its coupling to a
gradient it did not make. Built of ordinary matter, it satisfies every energy condition trivially,
because there is nothing exotic in it to check.

Two couplers are assessed. The **curvature swimmer** (Wisdom 2003) is a real effect and a dead
engine, bounded by `Δs ≤ A·a_tide/c²` ≈ 10⁻¹⁵ m per cycle — recorded as a bound. The **binary
slingshot** is live: a black hole binary is a flywheel already spinning, the fractional gain in γ per
pass does not saturate, and a steered vehicle keeps the first-order law a random population loses.
Worked point design: **0.87 c in 11 minutes at 1 g with zero propellant**, off two 27,900 M☉ holes.

Its honest limit is not physics but **inventory** — the engine is a found object, and no
intermediate-mass black hole binary is confirmed nearby. That reduces the question to an
observational one, which LISA is built to answer.

**And then most of the inventory problem dissolved.** Zhang's law is a law about *test particles*;
a person differs from a proton by having extent, and `person.py` finds that the extent enters
through exactly one group — the **fragility** `χ = √(extent / survivable tide)` against the
deflector's `τ_s = r_s/c`. The closest survivable pass is `k = (χ/τ_s)^(2/3)` r_s and nothing else
about either body enters. The consequence is a scaling identity: **a 2 m person at a 50 M☉ binary
and a proton at a 1.2 × 10⁹ kg one are the same mission** — same `k`, same gain, same 1,090 passes —
because `χ` rises by 8.2 × 10²² between them and so does the mass. The mission clock is the only
thing that differs, and it differs as `M`.

That turns the deep pass into a *choice*. Deflector mass falls as `k^{-3/2}` while passes rise only
as `k`, so trading gain for distance is a **3:2 exchange in your favour**: pulling the pass from
3 r_s out to 94.4 takes the deflector from 8,823 M☉ down to **50 M☉ — GW150914 was 36 + 29**. The
worked case is a person to 0.87 c in **4.3 hours at 1 g**, 1,090 passes off two catalogued holes,
zero propellant.

Two bounds came with it. The binary must *survive* the mission: orbits-to-merger goes as `β⁻⁵` and
passes as `1/β`, so the margin goes as `β⁻⁴` and **β ≤ 0.0587** — Zhang's headline `β = 0.2` misses
by 132×, and it is the clock that forbids it, not the mass. And the IMBH did not vanish, it *moved*:
Routh's `μ < (9−√69)/18` means a 50 M☉ deflector with a stable L4/L5 parking point needs a
**1,248 M☉** companion. The intermediate-mass hole is a **parking requirement, not a tidal one** —
which puts the whole remaining question on the station-keeping Δv, a number this tree has never
computed.

**Then a bill arrived that turned out not to be owed.** Every sheet in this tree carried one OPEN
row — the station-keeping Δv across N passes, "the number that decides whether the ship needs an
engine". `stationkeep.py` computed it and produced a theorem: a payload only returns for another
pass if it is gravitationally **bound**, bound means `E/m < 1` which *is* its γ at infinity, so
before the last pass `γ ≤ 1` and the terminal speed is set by **one** pass regardless of N. The
ladder was dead, 0.87 c was unreachable, and holding the payload for 1,090 passes cost **6.711 c**
of Δv.

**The arithmetic was right and the premise was wrong, and the literature says so — including the
paper this project's own gain law came from.** `E/m` is conserved in a *static* field. A binary is
not static:

- **Zhang 2020 §3.3** (arXiv:2001.09385): *"for a particle to escape the binary, it is not sufficient
  to just have enough energy. The particle has to consistently move in the same outward direction
  over a period of time. Such escape attempts are however frustrated by the rapidly shifting
  gravitational potential in the vicinity of the binary, due to the BHs moving about."*
- **Shipley & Dolan 2016** (CQG 33 175001, arXiv:1603.04469): a binary spacetime admits more than one
  fundamental null orbit and therefore **"an uncountably infinite set of perpetual null orbits"**. A
  photon cannot be more unbound than it is, and it can still fail to escape a pair. That alone
  disposes of "bound" as the return criterion.
- The dihole chaos Zhang cites: null geodesics in a two-black-hole field admit going-around sequences
  *"of arbitrary length — in fact, even infinitely lengthy ones where the geodesics do not ever escape
  or fall into either BH exist."*

**N is unbounded. The ladder stands and no Δv is owed: the binary turns the payload around for
free.** That is what the second body is for — and `stationkeep.py`'s static arithmetic, which was
never wrong, is exactly why one deflector cannot do the job: a single hole holds a payload for
**four passes** and then charges 6.18 × 10⁻³ c to get it back.

**The leading-face question is answered too, and Fermi answered it in 1949.** No converging-mirror
geometry is needed: aberration crowds incoming particles onto the head-on direction in the hole's
comoving frame, so accelerating encounters outnumber decelerating ones. Zhang states the consequence
outright — the mechanism *"is similar to the original Fermi acceleration, i.e., being of **second
order**"*.

**And that is the real bill.** Zhang's 50%-at-0.2 c is optimised over the entry phase φ₀ and the
angular momentum L. A payload that cannot choose those takes Fermi's average instead: one more
factor of β_A in the gain, hence **1/β_A times the passes**.

| β_A | N steered | N random | margin steered | margin random |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0.050 | 654 | 13,068 | 1.90 | 0.10 |
| **0.030** | **1,090** | **36,330** | **14.67** | **0.44** |
| 0.020 | 1,636 | 81,762 | 74.24 | 1.49 |

At the design point the unsteered payload wants 36,330 passes against 15,990 orbits before merger.
**The binary merges with the payload still aboard.**

> **Steering is not an optimisation of this architecture. It is the mechanism.**

`navigate.py`'s braid word finally has a job description: hold the first-order branch. And the open
item is no longer a fuel number but **ν, Zhang's per-pass vanquish probability** — the chance of
being swallowed by a hole or leaving early. For a *population* he estimates trajectories reaching
N = 1000 are suppressed by `(1−ν)⁹⁰⁰` (10⁻²⁷¹ at ν = ½), and argues ν *declines* as the payload
becomes more light-like. For a *vehicle* nobody has computed it — not here, and not in a literature
that is about cosmic rays rather than crews.

Two independent figures from the older three-body literature bracket the regime and neither
contradicts it. Aarseth's classical slingshot condition (arXiv:astro-ph/0511565, Eq. 3) is
`v_f = √(G M_t / 2a)`, which in this tree's variables is exactly `√2 β_A` — 0.289 c at the tightest
binary that can exist — and he notes close-pericentre encounters exceed it *"by a considerable
amount"*, which is precisely the optimised branch. Mikkola & Valtonen (1990) put the limiting
ejection speed for *black hole pairs* at ~10,000 km/s = 0.0334 c, an empirical ceiling from
galactic-nucleus mergers where GW inspiral caps how hard the binary gets — the same merger clock,
seen from the other end.

**A recorded fault, kept executable.** A first pass at this fixed the pass distance at a constant
fraction of the binary *separation* (`r_p = a/3`) and read off `M ∝ β³` — a person at 51 M☉ and
β = 0.03. The mass was very nearly right and the reasoning was wrong: `a/3` is 92.6 r_s out, where
an ultrarelativistic particle bends by 1.24°, and the gain there is 6.5 × 10⁻⁴ per pass rather than
the 0.075 the saturated law asserts — **overstated 115.7×**. `person.retracted_beta3_gain()`
recomputes the refutation so it cannot be quietly re-derived.

**A second scaling error, found later and larger than the first.** Every mass and density figure in
the first fifteen papers was quoted at the published example's `R₁ = 10 m`, and the size was never
varied. But `M ∝ R` while `ρ ∝ 1/R²`, so "666,000 × nuclear density" describes a 20 m ship and not
warp shells. `THE-DRIVE.md` runs the trade: there is **no material that makes a small warp shell**,
and **nuclear matter makes a 5 km one** — 1.11 M☉, 0.0476 c, flat interior, all four energy
conditions satisfied, by internal circulation at 0.330 c geared 6.94:1. That is the original
Architecture B topology at the right scale. The bill is ~10⁴⁶ J twice over and a neutron star: one
stellar catastrophe, not 10³¹.
