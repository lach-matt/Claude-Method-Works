# The Warp Theorem (M-RULINGS item 150; one statement built from the pieces; not verified; not seated; 2026-10-07)

*First headed* "(… not verified; not seated; 2026-10-07)". The first draft counted its lemmas wrongly, read the energy
ledger's remainder from item 139 alone, and left out four lemmas. All are corrected after the reassessment's verifier
(History).

## What you said

- **Item 150:** *"The approach needs to be to stop piecing together theorems to fit my theory, instead we need to
  consider one single theorem built from the pieces that defines the warp theory as a single statement"*.
- **So the board's separate results are now lemmas of one theorem.** What is not yet proved is a named lemma of it, not
  a separate question.
- **The instrument:** `warptheorem.py`. It imports exactE.py, coin.py, passage5d.py, localbulk.py and stability.py by
  path. Selftest 7/7, about 70 s.
  - **Genuine checks:** six.
  - **Control:** one.
  - **Marked STRUCTURAL:** one.

## The theorem

> **For an object whose README — its one fixed exact encoding, labels and values, written in what every universe
> shares — has N bits, there is exactly one corridor, fixed by N alone, and through it the README becomes, one way and
> exactly, the object at position 2.**

The corridor is the following, clause by clause.

- **(G) Geometry.**
  - It is Bronnikov–Kim's eq. (17) at r₀ = 2m on the plane.
  - **E = √(N h c⁵ ln2 / (8π²G)) = 459,404,002.42 J × √N.**
  - **m = GE/c⁴.**
  - **r₀ = 2m = √(N h G ln2 / (2π²c³)).**
- **(H) Holding.**
  - The throat holds exactly the README: **4πr₀² = N × 2hG ln2/(πc³)**, which is 4 ln2 Planck areas per bit.
  - The horizons hold it too.
- **(O) One way.**
  - The passage runs from position 1 to position 2 through an extremal horizon, with surface gravity 0.
  - It is nonsingular and complete, never runs back, and survives its hold.
- **(Z) Null energy never violated.**
  - Along the passage, a null geodesic of the five-dimensional geometry, the null energy is zero.
  - The plane's apparent deficit is exactly the bulk's pull.
- **(B) Bulk.**
  - A vacuum five-dimensional bulk carries the corridor. The plane is free of matter, at the Randall–Sundrum tension.
  - The plane's two ends are one end of the bulk.
  - The energy is positive at every point.
  - The bulk's scale k is fixed by the work.
  - The corridor opens and closes between static planes.
- **(I) Information.** The passage is N bits of entanglement, and it carries the N-bit README within the capacity
  bound.
- **(E) Energy.**
  - One exact energy E is carried from position 1 through three holds.
  - It is released into position 2 at the closing, and the build uses exactly it, with every joule accounted for.
- **(R) Reconstruction.**
  - The corridor takes the README at its opening.
  - Position 2's matter rearranges to the README exactly, with no tolerance, by a field reaction the README triggers.
    After that, position 2's laws govern.
  - The corridor's length is set by the trajectories, the difference between the two positions.

- **The count:** 30 lemmas. 10 are yours, 10 are proved, and **10 are OPEN**.
- **T2 (STRUCTURAL)** confirms that the theorem follows from all its lemmas, and that dropping any OPEN lemma loses it. So
  the ten are exactly what stands between the statement and a proof.

## The energy ledger: the one place your rulings pull against each other (T3)

- **What you ruled:**
  - E goes into position 2 (110);
  - the build uses *"that and only that which is provided by the closing"* (111 (a));
  - it is released at the closing and forms the mass the README defines (136 answer 2);
  - the README is the energy (136 G);
  - item 108's accounting: the README carries E/c², and the stock fills the rest.
- **Also yours:** matter is reorganized, not created (137); and the copy is exact, with no tolerance (146).
- **What z3 finds at the board's example README.**
  - E = 2.405878×10¹⁶ J.
  - An exact copy made of reorganized matter can itself absorb at most the assembly energy, 1.1947×10¹⁰ J.
  - So "the build uses all of E" is unsatisfiable unless the build includes something besides the copy that absorbs
    the rest. With such an absorber it is satisfiable.
  - **Control:** at N = 600 bits, E is 1.1253×10¹⁰ J, below the ceiling, and needs none.
- **The exact README is far larger than the example.**
  - Item 108's full snapshot is 1.088×10²⁹ bits. There E = 1.515×10²³ J, and E/c² is about 1.7×10⁶ kg, far above the
    body's mass.
  - At that size the tension is about seven orders of magnitude larger, and item 108's deficit accounting no longer
    applies.
- **The board's reading (a), adopted under item 149, labelled, and withdrawn if you correct it.**
  - The copy's matter is the stock's (137, 148).
  - E is absorbed as the expansion of position 2's universe that the README's absorption is:
    - 136 G: the README is the energy;
    - 136 answer 6: the bits are absorbed by position 2;
    - 139 (3): *"Absorbing of the README into position 2 is an expansion of that universe"*.
  - That expansion counts as part of the build, which keeps 111 (a).
  - Item 108's E/c² is then the appearance accounting of item 107, the definition read against the object, not added
    matter.
  - **What it keeps:** 110, 111, 136 (2) with "forming the mass" read as triggering the stock's rearrangement into it
    (110: *"the energy that triggers"*), 137, 146 and 148.
  - **What it reads differently:** item 108's literal "stock fills the deficit".
- **If you mean 108 literally instead,** E/c² becomes part of the copy's mass. Then 137 or 146 must give way for that
  part. That would be your call, not the board's.

## The work left, as the theorem's lemmas

- **Gating:**
  - B4 and B7 together, the corridor's five-dimensional form made and closed between static planes;
  - E3 and E4, the ledger;
  - O3, the hold's length;
  - B5, positivity for the pin.
- **Fixing:**
  - B6, k;
  - R4, the length;
  - I2, the capacity bound;
  - R5, the build's mechanism.

## Named hypotheses

- **Yours:** every lemma marked "yours", and M-ONE-THEOREM (150).
- **The board's:**
  - reading B4 as your items 126–127;
  - reading (a) for E3;
  - H-COMPOSITE-SURFACE, H-THICK-COMPOSITE, H-BK-CORRIDOR.

## History (from the reassessment's verifier, 2026-10-07)

- **The count was wrong.** It was "11 yours, 9 proved, 7 open"; the true count was 9, 10, 7. The instrument now prints
  the count from the list.
- **E3 read the remainder from item 139 alone, as a sink outside the build.** 139's words concern the trigger, and a
  sink outside the build runs against 111 (a). It is now reading (a), with its chain of rulings stated and the conflict
  named.
- **Four lemmas were missing:**
  - O3, the hold's length. "A few clocks" was the board's assumption, not a ruling.
  - E4, the field energy outside the neck.
  - R0, the read, from your items 70, 101 answer 8, 115 (c) and 130 (2).
  - R5, the build's mechanism.
- **Three lemmas were corrected.**
  - B5's positivity is the board's composite reading of your "entangled" (140), not "fused".
  - B4 now names separate universes, no loop and the infinitely many planes.
  - I2 now states the capacity bound as READ: information is capped by what is sent to set up the interaction (MSY
    p.4), not by an entanglement count.
- **Z1's ray is a null geodesic of the five-dimensional geometry, not light** (item 90).
